    "### Generative models\n",
    "Before we jump in to the implementation of several GANs, we need to introduce _Generative Models_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us assume we have a bunch of images which forms the distribution of real images $P_{r}$.\n",
    "In our case (CIFAR10 dataset) the distribution consists of several classes: `horse, airplane, bird, frog, truck, deer, cat, dog, car, ship`.\n",
    "Instead of training a classifier to be able to label our data we now would like to generate samples which are \n",
    "similar to samples in the distributio $P_{r}$ formed by the bunch of images.\n",
    "The clue is, that we would like t generate **new samples** which were **not part** of the dataset, but look really similar.\n",
    " \n",
    "![CIFAR 10 Image](images/CIFAR10_collection.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "So in a mathematical way, we would like to approximate the real distribution $P_{r}$ with a model $P_{\\theta}$.\n",
    "With this *generative* model, we then would like to generate new samples out of our approximation $x \\sim P_{\\theta}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a name=\"gan\"></a>\n",
    "### Generative Adversarial Networks\n",
    "The basic idea of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) is to train a **generator network** to learn the underlying distribution.<sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup>\n",
    "In other words, we would like to design a generator machine, we can feed with noise and which outputs us nice samples following\n",
    "the distribution of real images $P_{r}$, but which were not part of the training dataset.\n",
    "So in our case, we would like to generate new samples of airplanes, cars, dogs etc..\n",
    " \n",
    " <img src=\"images/generator_machine.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"800\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "In our setup we use a neural network $G(z)$ as generator machine. \n",
    "The generator network $G(z)$ gets as input a noise vector $z$ sampled from a muldimensional noise distribution $z \\sim p(z)$.\n",
    "This space of $z$ is often called the latent space. The generator should then map the noise vector $z$ into the data space (the space where our\n",
    "real data samples lie) and output new samples/images $\\tilde{x} \\sim G(z)$. We would like to have these $\\tilde{x}$ very similar to the real samples $x \\sim P_{r}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the training of our generator network we need feedback, if the generated samples are of good or bad quality.\n",
    "Because a classical supervised loss is incapable for giving a good feedback to the generator network, it is trained in an unsupervised manner.\n",
    "So instead of using \"mean squared error\" or similar metrics, the performance measure is given by a **second** _adversarial_ neural network, which is called _discriminator_.\n",
    "In the vanilla GAN setup, the way of measuring the quality of the generated sampels should be given by a classifier which is trained\n",
    "to classify between fake `class=0` (generated by our generator network) and real images `class=1` (from our bunch of images).\n",
    "\n",
    "The clue is now, that the generator should try to fool the discriminator.\n",
    "So, by adapting the generator weights the discriminator should fail to identify the fake images, and should output `class=1` (real images)\n",
    "when generated images are input. The crucial thing is, that we can directly get this feedback when stacking the generator on top\n",
    "of the discriminator to build our GAN framework. Because both are neural networks, we just can propagate the gradient \n",
    "through the discriminator to the generator, which can then adapts it weights to generate samples of better quality.\n",
    "In simple words, the generator should change the weights in a way to generate images which hold features the discriminator identifies\n",
    "as features from real images.\n",
    "When iteratively adapting the weights of the discriminator and generator, the performance of generated images should increase stepwise.\n",
    "This is the fascinating idea of _adversarial training_.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/adversarial_training_sketch.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"800\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "In a very figurative sense, the discriminator could be seen as painter which is able to classify between\n",
    "real images and fake images, because he knows a little bit about colors and art. We now would like to build a generator machine\n",
    "which produce nice photographs.\n",
    "The idea is, to fool the painter (discriminator) by changing the parameters of our generator machine.\n",
    "Because the painter has knowledge how \"real images\" look like, the feedback of him helps to let our generator machine generate\n",
    "images of better quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a name=\"gan_theory\"></a>\n",
    "#### Adversarial training\n",
    "After introducing the basic idea of adversarial training, let us now understand the math and focus on the algorithm itself.\n",
    " \n",
    "Our adversarial framework consists out of 2 networks:\n",
    "- the generator network $G$ (learn the mapping from noise $z$ to images $\\tilde{x}$)\n",
    "- the discriminator $D$ network (measures the image quality, by discriminating if the images are true `class=1` or fake `class=0`)\n",
    "\n",
    "The iterative update procedure of the framework is as follows:\n",
    "    1. Discriminator update: Train the discriminator to classify between fake and real images\n",
    "    2. Generator update: Train the generator to fool the generator\n",
    "    -  Repeat from beginning\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Discriminator update\n",
    "Sample noise vector from the latent space $z \\sim p(z)$.\n",
    "Generate new fake samples by feeding the sampled vector $z$ in to the generator $G(z)$ to obtain the new samples $\\tilde{x} \\sim G(z)$.\n",
    "Subsequently, we sample from the real distribution and obtain a bunch of samples $ x \\sim P_{r}$.\n",
    "We now train the discriminator using the binary cross entropy by changing the weights $w$ of the discriminator:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\mathcal{L}_{Dis} = \\min{ -\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbf{x} \\sim p_{data}(\\mathbf{x})} [log(D_w(\\mathbf{x}))] - \\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbf{z} \\sim p_z(\\mathbf{z})} [log(1-D_w(G_{\\theta}(\\mathbf{z})))]}$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is just the typical supervised training of a classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Generator update\n",
    "Sample noise from the latent space $z \\sim p(z)$\n",
    "Generate new fake samples by feeding the noise into the generator $G(z)$ and obtain a bunch of generated samples $\\tilde{x} \\sim G(z)$\n",
    "Now we freeze the weights $w$ of the discriminator.\n",
    "Finally, we train the generator to fool the discriminator, by adapting the weights $\\theta$ of our generator network:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\mathcal{L}_{Gen} = \\max{ -\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbf{z} \\sim p_z(\\mathbf{z})} [log(1-D_w(G_{\\theta}(\\mathbf{z})))]}$\n",
    "\n",
    "By iteratively passing these steps of discriminator and generator updates, we train our framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Architectures\n",
    "Building a powerful architecture of the discriminator and generator is rucial for successful GAN training.\n",
    "Remember, that the generator maps from the latent space into the data space.\n",
    "Hence, the input should be a 1D-vector of noise variables and the output should have image dimensions.\n",
    "In this case the output will have the dimension `(32, 32, 3)`. (3 color channels: RGB)\n",
    "\n",
    "[Radford, Metz, and Chintala](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434) proposed stable architectures for generator and discriminator networks.\n",
    "These DCGAN \"guidelines\" can be summarized as follows:\n",
    "- Replace fully connected layers with convolutional layers\n",
    "- Do not use pooling layers, use striding instead\n",
    "- Make use of batch normalization in generator and discriminator to stabilize training<sup>[2](#myfootnote2)</sup>\n",
    "- Use [LeakyReLU](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.00853.pdf) activation in discriminator for better feedback<sup>[3](#myfootnote3)</sup>\n",
    "- Use a pyramidal topology in the generator by using transposed convolutions, to support a simple and strucutred latent space\n",

    "--- Footnotes\n",
    "\n",
    "<a name=\"myfootnote1\">1</a>: In contrast to e.g. _Variational Autoencoders_ the idea is not to \"fit the distribution in a space of compressed representation\"\n",
    "but to train a generator which approximates the real distribution directly.\n",
    "Remember that in VAEs we learn a mapping in to the latent space where we can \"fit\" a gaussian. Therefore, after the training we can just\n",
    "generate new samples by sampling from the latent space using the Gaussian prior.\n",
    "Because most problems are to complex, the Gaussian is not able to capture all modes, this leads to blurry images which is\n",
    "a well known problem for VAE generated samples. Furthermore, VAEs minimize the Kullback-Leibler divergence, which is not a well suitable distance measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a name=\"myfootnote2\">2</a>: Batch normalization is very important here. Due to the normalization of the gradients, it stabilizes the training.\n",
    "As we will see [later](#sngan_normalization) normalizing the gradients delivered by the discriminator, is crucial.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a name=\"myfootnote3\">3</a>: Using ReLU in the discriminator would lead to sparse gradient (no negative gradient could propagate back).\n",
    "Using LeakyReLU provides better feedback. Also pooling would provide sparse gradients.\n",

    "In a more figurative sense, samples which lie outside of the support of the real and fake images will be very noisy and can blow\n",
